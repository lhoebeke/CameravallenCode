## Gdrive interaction module

In this folder, a small Python module to interact with the GDrive folder containing a set of deployments is provided.

For an overview of the functionalities, see the Jupyter notebook, the code is contained in the `gdrive_interaction.py` script. 

Before you can use the Google API, make sure to register your Python application. The information (link to tutorial) and requirements (usage of the `credentials_setup.py` in this folder to make the authentification) is explained in the notebook as well.
